Apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake, I thought using the events of 9/11 as a reason to make \\\"Larson the Lunatic Implodes, all over a screen near you\\\" disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9/11. Using a phone call from Larson's wife, Sarah, supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day, was appalling. The camera shake didn't make me feel sick, that cold hearted stunt did.\",\n          \"If I had never seen an episode of the original Avengers, with Blackman, Rigg, or Thorson, I would have appreciated this series more. While the cast did its best to sustain the action and interest of the scripts, I was just caught up in comparing the episodes to the original series. There was an expectation of Steed participating more in fight scenes, and the continuity seemed as though the writers were struggling to keep up with the actors. To be honest, I can't blame them for trying to resurrect the fans from the original series, but it just didn't work, as evidenced by the fact that it lasted one season. Watching Steed labor through this series reminded me of Gen. Macarthur when he said, 'Old soldiers never die, they just fade away!'\",\n          \"I watch this movie at the start of every summer, and it never ceases to amuse me.

Mischa Barton tries to talk with a plummy English accent, Dominique Swain whines a lot and Brad Renfro receives a blow job from some old guy.

He acts well. Lacey Chabert I tend to like, but no luck here. Due to good work in other films, I will forgive Mischa Barton this travesty, but I hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvement.<br /><br />Please, I implore you. Avoid.

Instead we have to endure a raw character expos\\u00e9e seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and Cillian Murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetet.<br /><br />The film never seems to decide on where it's going. There's no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldn't!?) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them. Miller is the choice of the two (I found Knightley competent at best but then I have never found her sympathetic) but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent Welsh accents. Other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of William (Murphy), arty production (eg double crossfades) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn't blend. 4/10\",\n\"negative\"],\n [{\n            'v': 32511,\n            'f': \"32511\",\n        },\n\"Okay, you have:<br /><br />Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E.

Although Stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, Winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader (John McIntire, especially great) and outlaw Dan Duryea, who's even more despicable than usual. The film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with Mann's pared-down, compositionally rigorous film-making. His themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun, but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husband's cowardice and failed attempt at atonement, and are defined in Stewart's conversations with sidekick Millard Mitchell. Mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns. Instead of gazing at vistas from afar, he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect, complicate, or evoke the human characters' goals. Just as mountains, caves, and rapids had to be accounted for in The Naked Spur, here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain, a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters. (I would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer William H. Daniels's contribution, particularly his superlative day-for-night, open-range photography.) Not merely an adept outdoorsman, Mann presents an equally vivid picture of Wyatt Earp-patrolled Dodge City, primarily through scaled, multiple-plane staging. The shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because Mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot. Nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue, relying on the actors' eyes or a well-chosen image to convey the stakes. One scene in particular serves to explain his attitude: Mitchell's telling of Stewart's motivation to Shelley Winters, which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all. Light without feeling insubstantial, intense without being overbearing, Winchester '73 seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold.\",\n\"positive\"]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"string\", \"review\"], [\"string\", \"sentiment\"]],\n        columnOptions: [{\"width\": \"1px\", \"className\": \"index_column\"}],\n        rowsPerPage: 25,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n\n      function appendQuickchartButton(parentElement) {\n        let quickchartButtonContainerElement = document.createElement('div');\n        quickchartButtonContainerElement.innerHTML = `\n<div id=\"df-ac8b5a1d-29ef-46d3-b261-23114526755d\">\n  <button class=\"colab-df-quickchart\" onclick=\"quickchart('df-ac8b5a1d-29ef-46d3-b261-23114526755d')\"\n            title=\"Suggest charts\"\n            style=\"display:none;\">\n    \n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n     width=\"24px\">\n    <g>\n        <path d=\"M19 3H5c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zM9 17H7v-7h2v7zm4 0h-2V7h2v10zm4 0h-2v-4h2v4z\"/>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n  </button>\n  \n<style>\n  .colab-df-quickchart {\n      --bg-color: #E8F0FE;\n      --fill-color: #1967D2;\n      --hover-bg-color: #E2EBFA;\n      --hover-fill-color: #174EA6;\n      --disabled-fill-color: #AAA;\n      --disabled-bg-color: #DDD;\n  }\n\n  [theme=dark] .colab-df-quickchart {\n      --bg-color: #3B4455;\n      --fill-color: #D2E3FC;\n      --hover-bg-color: #434B5C;\n      --hover-fill-color: #FFFFFF;\n      --disabled-bg-color: #3B4455;\n      --disabled-fill-color: #666;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart {\n    background-color: var(--bg-color);\n    border: none;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    display: none;\n    fill: var(--fill-color);\n    height: 32px;\n    padding: 0;\n    width: 32px;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart:hover {\n    background-color: var(--hover-bg-color);\n    box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n    fill: var(--button-hover-fill-color);\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart-complete:disabled,\n  .colab-df-quickchart-complete:disabled:hover {\n    background-color: var(--disabled-bg-color);\n    fill: var(--disabled-fill-color);\n    box-shadow: none;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-spinner {\n    border: 2px solid var(--fill-color);\n    border-color: transparent;\n    border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n    animation:\n      spin 1s steps(1) infinite;\n  }\n\n  @keyframes spin {\n    0% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-left-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    20% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-left-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-top-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    30% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-left-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-top-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    40% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-top-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    60% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    80% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    90% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n  }\n</style>\n\n  <script>\n    async function quickchart(key) {\n      const quickchartButtonEl =\n        document.querySelector('#' + key + ' button');\n      quickchartButtonEl.disabled = true;  // To prevent multiple clicks.\n      quickchartButtonEl.classList.add('colab-df-spinner');\n      try {\n        const charts = await google.colab.kernel.invokeFunction(\n            'suggestCharts', [key], {});\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error during call to suggestCharts:', error);\n      }\n      quickchartButtonEl.classList.remove('colab-df-spinner');\n      quickchartButtonEl.classList.add('colab-df-quickchart-complete');\n    }\n    (() => {\n      let quickchartButtonEl =\n        document.querySelector('#df-ac8b5a1d-29ef-46d3-b261-23114526755d button');\n      quickchartButtonEl.style.display =\n        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
