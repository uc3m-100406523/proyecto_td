    "  The word \"*car*\" is sampled from $P(w | \\text{\"The\"})$, followed by sampling \"*drives*\" from $P(w | \\text{\"The\"}, \\text{\"car\"})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  We can activate sampling by setting ``do_sample=True``.\n",
    "\n",
    "  One issue with sampling is that the models tend to produce incomprehensible nonsense. This may be solved by sharpening the conditional probability distribution by raising the likelihood of high-probability words and decreasing the likelihood of low-probability words, i.e.,  by lowering the softmax's so-called ``temperature``:\n",

    "  The conditional next word distribution of step $t=1$ becomes much sharper leaving almost no chance for the word \"*car*\" to be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In practice, the Transformers library provides two different sampling methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "  *   **Top-k sampling:** The $K$ most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is redistributed among only those $K$ next words. GPT2 adopted this sampling scheme, which was one of the reasons for its success in story generation:\n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "    Having set $K = 6$, in both sampling steps we limit our sampling pool to 6 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We activate top-K by setting ``top_k`` to the size of the candidate set:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    sample_output = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, top_k=50)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  *   **Top-p (nucleus) sampling:** Instead of sampling only from the most likely K words, Top-p sampling chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability p. The probability mass is then redistributed among this set of words. This way, the size of the set of words (a.k.a the number of words in the set) can dynamically increase and decrease according to the next word's probability distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <br><center><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11bTzQPA_cNIPfJwaTMcwPMHfXF6aRYUn\" width=\"70%\"></center><br>\n",

    "  \n",
    "    We activate Top-p sampling by setting ``top_p``to 0 < top_p < 1 and ``top_k`` to 0:\n",
